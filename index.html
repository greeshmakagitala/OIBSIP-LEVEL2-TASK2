        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
          Virat Kohli started his cricket career at the age of 18, playing for
          Delhi in the Ranji Trophy. He made his international debut in August
          2008, in an ODI against Sri Lanka. He is known for his aggressive
          batting style and his exceptional fielding skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its
          tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against
          England Under-19s, while also averaging 49 in the three-match Test
          series. Following India Under-19's success in both the ODI and Test
          series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in
          facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for
          profound technical prowess. In September, the India Under-19 team
          toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as
          India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s. In the second match,
          he contributed 83 runs to India's victory by 240 runs and an innings.
          He concluded the tour with 80 runs in the final ODI game at Lahore. In
          early 2007, Kohli was a part of the India Under-19 team that toured
          New Zealand, where he scored 113 in the first Test match. The series
          ended in a draw with a 1–1 scoreline. In the following month, the team
          travelled to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and
          Sri Lanka Under-19s, where Kohli did not get many opportunities to
          bat. In July–August, India Under-19 embarked on a tour for a
          tri-series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where
          he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. However, he
          made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following
          Test series. In February–March 2008, Kohli assumed the captaincy of
          the Indian squad that went on to triumph at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket
          World Cup held in Malaysia. He demonstrated his competence as a
          batsman, amassing 235 runs in 6 games at an average of 47, ranking as
          the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to
          compile a century. His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls,
          versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was
          lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as "the innings of the tournament." This
          innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the
          man of the match award. Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in
          the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2
          wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was significant to
          India's 3-wicket victory. In the championship match, Kohli managed a
          modest score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s, his contribution
          lead to India's eventual 12-run win (via D/L method). In June of the
          year 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay
          Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. This
          scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen cricketers,
          provided an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's
          Centre of Excellence in Brisbane. In a bid to identify potential
          talent for the senior team, Kohli was selected to represent India
          Emerging Players in the Emerging Players Tournament of 2008. Notably,
          his finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand
          Emerging Players, where he played a knock of 120 runs, leading India
          to a seven-wicket victory. With an aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli's
          performances did not go unnoticed by the national selectors who were
          observing his progress. With twenty-eight under-19 ODIs and twelve
          under-19 Tests, he embarked on his journey to international cricket by
          joining the senior team on their flight to Colombo.
